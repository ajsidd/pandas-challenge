# PyCity Schools Analysis

Welcome to the PyCity Schools Analysis project repository! This project involves the analysis of school performance and student outcomes within the PyCity School District. The analysis is conducted using Python's Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to provide insights into various aspects of school performance and student outcomes. The analysis covers the following key areas:

- District-wide summaries
- School-level performance metrics
- Grade-level comparisons
- Impact of factors such as school spending, size, and type on academic achievement

## Files Included:

- **PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code and analysis for the PyCity Schools project. It includes data loading, data manipulation, calculations, and visualizations.
- **Resources/schools_complete.csv**: CSV file containing school-related data, including school name, budget, and type.
- **Resources/students_complete.csv**: CSV file containing student-related data, including student name, grade, and test scores.
